# The priority is based upon order of creation:
# first created -> highest priority.

# Samples of regular routes:
#   match  "/Book"  "Book#view"
#   get    "/"  "Blog#index"
#   post   "/New/:params"  "Account#entry"

get    "/"                  "Shorturl#index"

# We need to define these explicitly in order to ensure we can create
get    "/Shorturl/entry"    "Shorturl#entry"
post   "/Shorturl/create"   "Shorturl#create"

# post   "/shorturl/show/:params"   "Shorturl#show"

# Everything else we should redirect to the keyword
get    "/:params"  "Shorturl#show"
